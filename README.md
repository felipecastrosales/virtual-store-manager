<h2 align="center">Functionalities 🛠️</h2>

   <p>
   
- Manage the Virtual Store;
- Manage the Virtual Store as a whole;
- On orders:
    - View the entire history of products sold,
    - View customers and their order list (with total),
    - Being able to sort the list.
- Customers:
    - Access all customers of your store,
    - View your purchases.
- In the products tab:
    - Create,
    - Read,
    - Updates,
    - Delete.
    - When creating a product you must fill in all the fields to register them (with photos and texts), with a field validation.
- This application will help a lot to not have to keep updating all my products directly from Firebase, but the app, which is much simpler and faster!
- Among many other benefits and features that I will add with new updates!

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p align="center">
   When studying Flutter, I see that many things that used to be a little complex for me, today are no longer as they were before.<br>
   In this application, I reviewed many widgets, I understood even more about logic, about BLoC, which separes logic from layout, and I did very well developing this application.<br>
   Every day I feel that I am evolving more and more, and I hope it never stops!
